## 1. Introduction

Monilla is CLI tool which enables the development of clean `npm`-based [monorepos](https://monorepo.tools). Some of its core features includes;

- Quickly install dependencies across your monorepo;
  ```bash
  monilla install
  ```
- Seamlessly link your packages within your monorepo;
  ```bash
  monilla link @my/components --to @my/ui
  ```
- Perform interactive dependency updates across your monorepo;
  ```bash
  monilla update-deps
  ```
- Coordinate command execution across your monorepo packages, whilst respecting their dependency tree;
  ```bash
  monilla run build
  ```

It avoids the use of workspaces or hoisting, treating each of your monorepo packages as though they were independent packages. We find that this approach increases the predictability and stability of packages within your monorepo. Dependency updates to one package should not affect another.

We lean heavily into a "standard" npm experience and promote the capability for packages to be easily lifted in or out of your monorepo.

&nbsp;

---

## 2. Goals

- Leverage standard `npm` as far as possible.

  At any time you should be able to stop using `monilla` and just run standard `npm` commands. Yes, you might have to execute a lot of `npm` commands depending on how many packages are in your project, but you'll be able to do so at the least.

- Each package should be as though it were an independent `npm` package.

  We expect that each package within your monorepo is built almost as if it were independent. It's own package.json scripts, dependencies, etc. This should allow for cleaner publishing of packages to an `npm` registry, whilst also enabling lifting and shifting of packages in or out of your monorepo.

&nbsp;

---

## 3. Prerequisites

You need the following available on your system to use this CLI;

- **Node.js** version `18.4.0` or higher

We highly recommend the use of [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), which allows you to install and switch between multiple versions of Node.js seamlessly.

Once you have it installed you can install the required version of the Node.js via the following command;

```bash
nvm install --default 18
```

This will install the latest version of the major version 18 of Node.js, whilst also making it the default Node.js version that will be used on your machine.

&nbsp;

## 4. Setup

**Installation**

We recommend performing a global installation of monilla;

```bash
npm install monilla -g
```

> You can safely install it as a direct dependency at the root of your monorepo if you prefer/need.
>
> ```bash
> npm install monilla --save-dev
> ```

**Configuration**

After the installation completes run the following command at the root of your monorepo;

```bash
monilla init
```

This will create a `.monilla.json` configuration file (if it does not yet exists) and update your `.gitignore` configuration file (if it exists) with the recommended excludes.

&nbsp;

## 5. Guide

Imagine a monorepo with the following structure:

```
my-mono-repo
|
|- apps
|  |
|  |- @my/mobile-app
|     |- src
|     |  |- index.js
|     |- package.json
|
|- packages
|  |
|  |- @my/components
|     |- src
|     |  |- index.js
|     |- package.json
|
|- package.json
```

Using this as a reference, we'll describe a few scenarios below.

> Note: I'm prefixing each of the `monilla` commands with `npx`. If you are unfamiliar with `npx` you can [read more about it here](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npx). tldr - It will allow you to quickly execute commands against the locally installed `monilla` CLI.

&nbsp;

### 5.1. Initialising your dependencies

If you are performing a fresh clone of a repository, or switching branched, then we recommend you run the following command;

```bash
monilla install
```

This performs two functions;

- Ensures that any linked packages are properly bound
- Ensures the correct dependencies are installed for each package

&nbsp;

### 5.2. Linking and Unlinking packages

The example monorepo contains a mobile app, and a components library. If we wished to utilise the components library within the mobile app we can link the package.

You can do so by running the `link` command within the root of your monorepo;

```bash
monilla link @my/components --to @my/mobile-app
```

> Note: if the source package has a `build` script it will be executed prior to performing the link.

Conversely, if you'd like to `unlink` a package you can do the following;

```bash
monilla unlink @my/components --from @my/mobile-app
```

> **Note:** Monilla does not support circular dependencies between packages and will throw an error or warning if you try to create one.

&nbsp;

### 5.3. Making updates to your linked packages

If you've performed updates to one of your linked packages, you can ensure that all dependants are using the latest version via the following command;

```bash
monilla refresh
```

> Note: if your linked package has a `build` script it will be executed prior to performing the refresh.

&nbsp;

### 5.4. Watching updates to your linked packages

To watch for changes to your packages, resulting in automatic building and refreshing of the packages, execute the following command;

```bash
monilla watch
```

> **Note:** We utilise your `.gitignore` file to determine which files to ignore when executing this process.

&nbsp;

### 5.5. Performing an interactive update of dependencies across all packages

To perform an interactive update of the dependencies for all of the packages within your monorepo execute the following command;

```bash
monilla update-deps
```

You'll be asked which packages you'd like to update for each of the packages within your monorepo. After this has completed we'll take care of the installs and refreshing of your linked packages.

## 7. Appreciation

A huge thank you goes to [@wclr](https://github.com/wclr) for the outstanding work on [Yalc](https://github.com/wclr/yalc). The Yalc workflow is the specific seed which enabled this idea to grow. üåª

An additional thank you is extended to [@raineorshine](https://github.com/raineorshine) for the amazing work on [`npm-check-update`](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates). Updating dependencies would be too laborious without this amazing tool. We couldn't have done it better ourselves, so we have incorporated `npm-check-update` directly. ‚òÄÔ∏è
